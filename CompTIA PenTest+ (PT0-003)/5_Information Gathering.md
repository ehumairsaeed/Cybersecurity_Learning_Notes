## üß† Section: Information Gathering

### üîπ Summary  
In this section of the course i have learned about the information gathering of the target servet's like softwares , versions , services , open ports 

---

### üß∞ Tools & Examples  
| Tool | Pourpose |
|------|-----|
| tcpdump |   to dump network packets   |
| Wireshark |   to check the packets   | 
| Telnet |   to do banner grabing |
| Beautyful Soup  |   to get a html code    |
| NMAP     |   to scan the ports and also their running softwares    |
|  NETCAT    |   to investigate a network   |
|  curl    |   to get banner from the web server   |

### üîë Key Concepts  
- What is Inforamtion Gathering
- Difference between pasive recon. and active recon.
- OSINT
- Passive Reconnaissance
- Network Recon.
- Internet of Things (IoT) & Openrational Technology (OT)
- Active Reconnaissance
- Port and Protocol Scaning 
- HTML Scraping and Cached Pages
- Banner Grabing
- Practical of the Banner Grabing

### üìå Key Terms  
| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Passive Reconnaissance | Gathering information of the target without directly interacting with their systems |
| Active Reconnaissance     |  Directly intracting with target's systems to gather data           |
| OSINT(Open-Source Intelligence )     |  Using publicly available sources to gather information about the target            |
| Network Sniffing     |   Capturing pakects of data as they travel accross a network          |
| Network Recon.     |  Focussing on gathering information about a network topology and identifing the open ports, services on the network            |
| Packet Capture (PCAP)     |      Capture and log the data packets flowing accross a network during a specified period       |
| Protocol Scannning     |     Sending packets to the target to find which protocol is being used like FTP, SMTP, SSH, HTTP        |
| Port Scaning     |      Sending Packets to specific ports on a host and analyzing responces to learn about port states and servers       |
|   Banner Grabing   |      Helps to gather iformation about the remote server's software and versions       |
