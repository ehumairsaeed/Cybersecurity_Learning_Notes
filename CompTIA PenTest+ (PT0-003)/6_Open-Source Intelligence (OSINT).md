### üîë Key Concepts  
- What is open-source intelligence
- Gathering inforamtion from Social Media and Job Boards
- Gathering information about the target from Information Disclosure
- Cryptographic Flaws
- DNS Lookups and Reverse DNS Lookups
- Certificate transparancy log

### üìå Key Terms  
| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| OSINT | Gathering info from public sources |
| Information Disclosure | Occure when a system, application or service exposse sensitive data that can be accessed without authorization |

- If you want some of the critical information that is provided by the company sttaf then check the social media profiles of the company employe
- In Information Disclosure data can be accesssed by the misconfiguration of the servers and unwanted open ports
- Start OSINT From the social media account of the organization
