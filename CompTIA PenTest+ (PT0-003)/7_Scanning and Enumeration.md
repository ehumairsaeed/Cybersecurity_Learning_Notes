### üß∞ Tools & Examples  
| Tool | Usage Example |
|------|---------------|
|   NMAP   |       `nmap -T4 -F 192.168.1.0/24`        |
|   PING   |       `ping 192.168.1.1`       |
|   SMB CLIENT   |       `smbclient -L \\192.168.1.1\IPC$ -U guest`        |
|   NS LOOKUP   |       `nslookup google.com`        |
|   DIG   |       `dig -x google.com`       |
|   GOBUSTER   |      `gobuster dir -u https://google.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt`       |
|   THE HARVESTER   |      `theHarvester -d google.com -l 500 -b  google  `       |
|   SMBMap   |      `smbmap -H 192.168.1.1`       |
|   PACU   |             |

### üìå Key Terms  
| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
|   Enumeration   |      Involves taking the information gathered during OSINT phase       |
|   Protocol Enumeration   |     Provides a good understading of how services and applications talk to each other over the network        |
