### ‚úèÔ∏è Section: Security Architecture

**üìå Summary:**  
In this section of the course i have learned about the Secutrity Artitectures and gained knowladge about these things and how the security can be checked and managed.

**üß† Key Concepts:**  
- What is Security Artitecture
- On-Premise versus Cloud 
- Cloud Security 
- Vulnarability and Contenarizations
- What is Serverless Computing
- What is Microservices Artitecture
- What is software define networking
- What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Differrence Between centralized and Decentralized Artitecture
- What is Internet of Things (IoT)
- What is ICS and SCADA
- What is Embedded Systems




**üîë Important Terms:**  
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
|   Security Artitecture   |    Design , Structure and Behaviour of the organizations information security environment     |
|   On-Premise   |    Traditional Method of setting up infrastrucutre and services locally     |
|   Cloud Computing   |    Delevering computing services over the internet     |
|   Serverless   |    Model where the responsibility of managing the servers , databases, and some application logics is shifted away from developers     |
|   Microservices   |    A software artitecture where large services are broken down into smaller and independent services     |
|   Software-Define Networking   |    Enables efficient network configurations to improve performance and monitoring      |
|   Infrastructure as Code (IaC)   |    A Method in which IT infrastructures are defined in the Code files that can versioned , tested and audited     |
|   Idemportance   |    The ability of an operation to produce same result and it does not meatter how many it is runing      |
|   Centralized Artitecture   |     All the computing funtions are coordinated and Managed from a single location    |
|   Decentralized Artitecture   |     Computing funtions are destributed accross multiple systems or locations     |
|   Internet of Things (IoT)   |     The Network of physical items with embedded systems that enable connection and Data exchanges    |
|   Industirial Control Systems (ICS)   |    Control system used to monitor and control industrial process ranging from simple systems to complex systems     |
|   Supervisory control and Data Aquisitoion (SCADA)   |    A type of ICS used to monitor and control geographical industrial processes     |
|   Embedded Systems   |    Specilized Computing component designed to perform dedicated funntions within a large structure     |
