**üîë Important Terms:**  
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
|   Cryptography   |     Practice and study of writing and solving codes to hide the true meaning of information   |
|   Encryption   |    The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext     |
|   Cipher   |    A cipher is an algorithm that perform encryption and decryption     |
|   Key   |    A piece of information that determine the output of cipher     |
|   Symmetric Encryption   |    A single key that is used to encrypt and decrypt data     |
|   Asymmetric Encryption   |    Two key to encrypt and decrypt data, one key for encryption and second for decryption     |
|   Stream Cipher   |    Encrypt data bit-by-bit in continous stream     |
|   Block Cipher   |    Encrypts data inn fixed_sized blocks like 64bit,128bit or 256bit    |
|   Hashing   |    One way cryptographic funtion that takes input and produce unique message digits as output     |
